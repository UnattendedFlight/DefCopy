# DefCopy
I know it says AllCopy, and that's because AllCopy was the first project name. But i changed it and am to lazy to change every file/foldername.

This is a C# project made to copy a large amount of files over my local internet at no faster speed than doing it any other copying software.

## Installation

Just download the C# Installer and follow the instructions to install the newest version.

You are temporarily required to manually download winrar to default directory if you have not already.
This is due to Update v1.2.7ยง3

# You can find the latest release for the installer [here](https://github.com/UnattendedFlight/DefCopy/releases/latest "Sonder's latest release")

## Usage

1. Enter input folder(s) : Type "done" when finished.
2. Enter output folder(s) : (There is an option to copy all files to the same folder so you dont have to write it more than once)
3. Press enter.

Follow the instructions on screen, and the manager will handle the rest.

### ALTERNATE USE

1. Create a file called "copy.txt" and write all the to and from's in this format:

FROM ; TO ; FROM2 ; TO2 ; ETC

But, without the spaces. It should be like this:
`FROM;TO;FROM2;TO2;FROM3;TO3;etc`
e.g

`C:\Desktop\TotallyLegitBluerayRipps;D:\Movies\New;C:\Desktop\Porn;D:\Movies\Secret;etc`
